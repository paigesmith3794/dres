## Project Description

<Project name> revolves around fashion through providing a way for stylists to share their sense of fashion with users looking for a new look. <Project name> also provides users in need of a new outfit with a way to find one that suits their needs, whether they be monetary or something that is appropriate for the occasion.

A stylist will be able to create outfits providing different articles of clothing. Each outfit will have a total price and an occasion. For example, a stylist would be able to design an outfit for a wedding that costs less than $300 in total. The stylist will provide necessary information for each article of clothing in an outfit so that a shopper would be able to purchase each item to recreate the outfit as designed.

A shopper would be able to search for outfits for a specific occasion or within a certain price range. The application will only return outfits that meet the shopper's criteria.
